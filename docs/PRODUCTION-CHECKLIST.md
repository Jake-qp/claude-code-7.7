## Blocking Issues

None. The application is functionally complete for demo purposes.

## Recommendations (Non-Blocking)

### Before Production:

1. **Security**
   - Configure HTTPS redirect in deployment platform
   - Add security headers (helmet.js or Vercel config)
   - Consider adding custom rate limiting

2. **Performance**
   - Run Lighthouse audit on deployed version
   - Add image optimization if images are added
   - Configure CDN caching

3. **Reliability**
   - Add Sentry or similar error tracking
   - Create /api/health endpoint
   - Add retry logic for Stripe API calls

4. **Operations**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
   - Create staging environment
   - Create docs/DEPLOYMENT.md
   - Create docs/RUNBOOK.md

**Launch Status:** ⚠️ READY WITH WARNINGS

The application is functionally complete and passes all code-level checks. The warnings are for deployment-time configurations that need to be addressed before going live.
