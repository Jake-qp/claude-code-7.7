# Documentation Skill

Write docs that help people use and maintain the project.

## When This Skill Activates

- Creating or updating README
- Documentation completeness check
- API documentation
- User guides

## README Structure

Every project README should have:

```markdown
# Project Name

Brief description (one line).

## Features

- Feature 1
- Feature 2

## Quick Start

\`\`\`bash
# Install
npm install

# Run
npm run dev
\`\`\`

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| DATABASE_URL | Yes | PostgreSQL connection |

## Tech Stack

- Framework: Next.js 14
- Database: Supabase
- Auth: NextAuth.js

## Project Structure

\`\`\`
src/
  app/        # Routes
  components/ # UI
  lib/        # Utilities
\`\`\`

## Development

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server
npm test         # Run tests
npm run build    # Production build
\`\`\`

## Deployment

[Link to DEPLOYMENT.md or brief instructions]

## Contributing

[Link to CONTRIBUTING.md or brief guidelines]

## Doc Quality Checklist

### README.md
- [ ] One-line description
- [ ] Features list
- [ ] Quick start that actually works
- [ ] All env vars documented
- [ ] Tech stack listed
- [ ] Project structure
- [ ] Development commands
- [ ] Deployment info

### Code Comments
- [ ] Complex logic explained
- [ ] Public functions documented
- [ ] Non-obvious decisions noted
- [ ] TODOs have issue numbers

### API Documentation
- [ ] All endpoints listed
- [ ] Request/response examples
- [ ] Error codes explained
- [ ] Authentication requirements

## Writing Guidelines

### Be Concise
```markdown
❌ "In order to run the development server, you will need to execute the following command in your terminal:"

✅ "Start dev server:"
```

### Use Examples
```markdown
❌ "Pass the user ID to the function"

✅ "Get user: `getUser('user_123')`"
```

### Keep Updated
- Update docs when code changes
- Date-stamp major changes
- Remove outdated information

## Auto-Generated Docs

These docs are generated by skills:

| Document | Generated By | When |
|----------|--------------|------|
| ARCHITECTURE.md | initializer | First /build |
| DESIGN-SYSTEM.md | ui-design | First UI work |
| API-CONTRACTS.md | backend | Each endpoint |
| DATA-MODELS.md | database | Schema changes |
| AUTH-FLOWS.md | security | Auth implementation |
| DEPLOYMENT.md | devops | CI/CD setup |
| RUNBOOK.md | devops | CI/CD setup |
| MONITORING.md | devops | CI/CD setup |
| PRODUCTION-CHECKLIST.md | /launch | Launch check |

## Documentation for /launch

The `/launch` command checks:
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md exists and current
- [ ] API-CONTRACTS.md complete
- [ ] DEPLOYMENT.md has working commands
- [ ] README.md covers all essentials

Missing or incomplete docs flag as warnings.

## JSDoc for Functions

```typescript
/**
 * Creates a new order for the given user.
 * 
 * @param userId - The user creating the order
 * @param items - Array of items to include
 * @returns The created order with ID
 * @throws {ValidationError} If items array is empty
 * 
 * @example
 * const order = await createOrder('user_123', [
 *   { productId: 'prod_1', quantity: 2 }
 * ]);
 */
export async function createOrder(
  userId: string, 
  items: OrderItem[]
): Promise<Order> {
  // ...
}
```

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] README.md complete and accurate
- [ ] All env vars documented
- [ ] Quick start actually works
- [ ] Complex code has comments
- [ ] Generated docs are up to date
